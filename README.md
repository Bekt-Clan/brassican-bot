# Brassican Bot

A Discord bot that runs the rank system for the
[Bekt Clan](https://discord.gg/7EwEDg6ezT).

Public information about how the rank system works can be found in the `#ranks`
channel in the [clan's Discord server](https://discord.gg/7EwEDg6ezT).

## Documentation

This project is built using the [discord.js module](https://discord.js.org/). It
generally follows a typical discord.js project structure. The bot uses the
[Wise Old Man API](https://www.wiseoldman.net/) to get useful information about
in-game data. [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is used to interact with the
bot's MongoDB instance which is used for all persisted data.

If you are looking to get started understanding the code, it is recommended to
first familiarize yourself with
[discord.js's documentation](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.14.1).
It is very helpful, and will explain most of the background needed to understand
this repo.

The code QA is done with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). It is strongly recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions installed to work on this project.

The Bekt clan currently hosts both the bot's live application code and its
database instance on [Railway](https://railway.app/) (we maintain both a
production and test environment).
