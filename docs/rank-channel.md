# Cabbage Details

*Our system is fundamentally based on points. You can earn these points in a variety of ways and we call them <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775>cabbages<:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775>! Generally the more active you are in the clan and in game, the more cabbages you will amass and the higher your rank will be.*

## <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775> Core Cabbages <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775>

Everyone gets a base set of cabbages that will grow as they play OSRS. We call these core cabbages and they are your [EHP + EHB](<https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slang_dictionary/E>) on your main account. These are updated approximately every week and rank updates should automatically occur as this happens. We do this by pulling each member's stats from wiseoldman <:WiseOldMan:1052019995200212993>!

## <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775> Clan Cabbages <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775>

We also want your rank to represent how active you are in the clan. To achieve this, we give cabbages as a reward for activities in the clan. Some of the ways to earn these cabbages are as follows:

> - ðŸ¥‡ OTW event participants will earn cabbages based on where they finish  
>     (Typically ðŸ¥‡ 200 ðŸ¥ˆ 150 ðŸ¥‰ 100)
> - <:Check:1291164107554422815> Recruiting someone new into the clan earns 25 Cabbages (they must join Discord and the in-game clan)
> - <:BINGO:1202012145219538994> Active bingo participants will earn cabbages based on where they finish
> - <:heart:646398269915791391>  Hosting a meaningful event earns a variable number depending on the event. Events must be discussed and agreed with Moderators / Admins before being hosted to count
> - <:Clue_medium:1128097067324162068> Sporadic bounties earn variable numbers (ex. 'first person to get a pair of ranger boots will earn 10 cabbages', or 'first person to find <@138705528455954433> earns 20 cabbages')

## <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775> Bonus Cabbages <:cabbageclassic:822481888320159775>

>     (Easy 10 | Medium 25 | Hard 50 | Elite 100)
> - <:Combat_achievements:1288198896362717256> Your highest Combat Achievement tier earns the respective number of points:  
>     (Easy 10 | Medium 25 | Hard 50 | Elite 100 | Master 150 | Grandmaster 250)
