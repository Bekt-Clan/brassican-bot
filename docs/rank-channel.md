# Cabbage Details

*Our system is fundamentally based on points. You can earn these points in a variety of ways and we call them :cabbageclassic:cabbages:cabbageclassic:! Generally the more active you are in the clan and in game, the more cabbages you will amass and the higher your rank will be.*

## :cabbageclassic: Core Cabbages :cabbageclassic:

Everyone gets a base set of cabbages that will grow as they play OSRS. We call these core cabbages and they are your [EHP + EHB](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slang_dictionary/E) on your main account. These are updated approximately every week and rank updates should automatically occur as this happens. We do this by pulling each member's stats from wiseoldman :WiseOldMan:!

## :cabbageclassic: Clan Cabbages :cabbageclassic:

We also want your rank to represent how active you are in the clan. To achieve this, we give cabbages as a reward for activities in the clan. Some of the ways to earn these cabbages are as follows:
- OTW event participants will earn cabbages based on where they finish (usually this will be 100 for 1st place, 50 for 2nd, and 25 for 3rd but some weeks will have juicier rewards :grinning:)
- Recruiting someone new into the clan earns 25 Cabbages (they must join Discord and the in-game clan)
- Bingo participants will earn cabbages based on where they finish
- Hosting a meaningful event earns a variable number depending on the event. Events must be discussed and agreed with Moderators / Admins before being hosted to count
- Sporadic bounties earn variable numbers (ex. 'first person to get a pair of ranger boots will earn 10 cabbages', or 'first person to find @kimenu earns 20 cabbages')

## :cabbageclassic: Bonus Cabbages :cabbageclassic:

We will also give some bonus cabbages for specific account progression milestones (these all apply to the account you register for ranks with).

- Max Cape earns 100 Cabbages
- First Inferno Cape earns 100 Cabbages
- First Quiver earns 100 Cabbages
- First full Blorva earns 100 Cabbages
- First Quest Point Cape earns 100 Cabbages
- Your highest achievement diary tier earns the respective number of points:
    (Easy 10 | Medium 25 | Hard 50 | Elite 100)
- Your highest Combat Achievement tier earns the respective number of points:
    (Easy 10 | Medium 25 | Hard 50 | Elite 100 | Master 150 | Grandmaster 250)
- Every 100 Collection Log slots filled earn 25 cabbages
- Every 500th Collection Log slot that is filled earns a bonus 50 Cabbages

*Note that all the numbers above are subject to change at any time to better balance the rank system! Thanks for your understanding.*

# Interacting with the System

The following is a list of which bonus cabbage tasks require manual submission (if something isn't on this list it will automatically get added to your account next time our system updates it -- if you are itching to get your cabbages ASAP, feel free to open a ticket and a mod can manually trigger an update for your account!)

- First Quest Point Cape
- Your highest achievement diary tier
