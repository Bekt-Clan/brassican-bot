# Cabbage Details

*Our system is fundamentally based on points. You can earn these points in a variety of ways and we call them <app_emoji:cabbage>cabbages<app_emoji:cabbage>! Generally the more active you are in the clan and in game, the more cabbages you will amass and the higher your rank will be.*

## <app_emoji:cabbage> Core Cabbages <app_emoji:cabbage>

Everyone gets a base set of cabbages that will grow as they play OSRS. We call these core cabbages and they are your [EHP + EHB](<https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Slang_dictionary/E>) on your main account. These are updated approximately every week and rank updates should automatically occur as this happens. We do this by pulling each member's stats from wiseoldman <app_emoji:wom>!

## <app_emoji:cabbage> Clan Cabbages <app_emoji:cabbage>

We also want your rank to represent how active you are in the clan. To achieve this, we give cabbages as a reward for activities in the clan. Some of the ways to earn these cabbages are as follows:

> - 🥇 OTW event participants will earn cabbages based on where they finish  
>     (Typically 🥇 200 🥈 150 🥉 100)
> - :chart_with_upwards_trend: Recruiting someone new into the clan earns 25 Cabbages (they must join Discord and the in-game clan)
> - <app_emoji:bingo> Active bingo participants will earn cabbages based on where they finish
> - <app_emoji:pepe_heart>  Hosting a meaningful event earns a variable number depending on the event. Events must be discussed and agreed with Moderators / Admins before being hosted to count
> - <app_emoji:casket> Sporadic bounties earn variable numbers (ex. 'first person to get a pair of ranger boots will earn 10 cabbages', or 'first person to find <@138705528455954433> earns 20 cabbages')

## <app_emoji:cabbage> Bonus Cabbages <app_emoji:cabbage>

We will also give you some one-off bonus cabbages for specific account progression milestones (you can chose which account to have count for each bonus).

> - <app_emoji:max_cape> Achieving Max Cape earns 100 Cabbages
> - <app_emoji:infernal_cape> Achieving Inferno Cape earns 100 Cabbages
> - <app_emoji:quiver> Achieving Quiver earns 100 Cabbages
> - <app_emoji:ancient_blood_ornament_kit> Achieving Ancient Blood Ornament Kit earns 100 Cabbages
> - <app_emoji:purifying_sigil> Achieving Purifying Sigil earns 100 Cabbages
> - <app_emoji:quest_point> Achieving Quest Point Cape earns 100 Cabbages
> - <app_emoji:achievement_diaries> Your highest Achievement Diary tier completed across all diaries earns the respective points:
>     (Easy 10 | Medium 25 | Hard 50 | Elite 100)
> - <app_emoji:combat_achievements> Your highest Combat Achievement tier (points-based) earns the respective number of points:  
>     (Easy 10 | Medium 25 | Hard 50 | Elite 100 | Master 150 | Grandmaster 250)
> - <app_emoji:collection_log> Every 100 Collection Log slots filled earn 25 cabbages
> - 🎉 Every 500th Collection Log slot that is filled earns a bonus 50 Cabbages

*Note that all the numbers above are subject to change at any time to better balance the rank system! Thanks for your understanding.*
